    PostProcessor objects can be added to downloaders with their
    add_post_processor() method. When the downloader has finished a
    successful download, it will take its internal chain of PostProcessors
    and start calling the run() method on each one of them, first with
    an initial argument and then with the returned value of the previous
    PostProcessor.

    The chain will be stopped if one of them ever returns None or the end
    of the chain is reached.

    PostProcessor objects follow a "mutual registration" process similar
    to InfoExtractor objects.

    Optionally PostProcessor can use a list of additional command-line arguments
    with self._configuration_args.
